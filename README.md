# RooPad-ADJ
Fixed QMK Code and Scans of the circuit board and housing plates of Skippy's Custom PCs' RooPad (consider this an Archival Backup aswell).

The code found on QMK Config made the numpad act in a weird way, where the LEDs did not work and certain columns were displayed incorrectly (e.g. pressing 1 resulted in 2 popping up on screen) or were not working at all (e.g. pressing Enter, +, -, - resulted in no response).

I fixed the code found on the QMK Config website and identified the following issues:


  ~  First column was working correctly.

  ~  Second and Third columns were off by one column, where pressing number 1 resulted in 2 displaying on screen.

  ~  Fourth and Fifth columns did not work at all.

  ~  First row did not work, where pressing Num Lock, /, *, - resulted in no response.

  ~  LEDs did not work at all.


The following below is just information found on the sale page of this Numpad on Skippy's Custom PCs website:
